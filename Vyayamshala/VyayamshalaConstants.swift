In a world where bodybuilders continue to grow bigger and bigger, Coleman has set a new standard – the Louisiana-born bodybuilder has a contest weight of about 300 pounds, something that not many bodybuilders achieve. Coleman got his start as a football player, initially working out so he could be more impressive on the field. He continued playing football while he attended Grambling State University, and actually planned to become an accountant. You heard it – this giant muscle man was planning to spend all his days at a desk. However, his plans changed when he moved to Texas for some new job opportunities. While doing everything possible to stay afloat in a hard job market, Coleman saw an advertisement for the police force, and started a career there. Coleman’s fellow officers convinced him to check out a particularly impressive gym in their neighbourhood, whose clientele consisted of powerlifters and competitive builders. The rest, as they say, is history. Coleman immediately impressed at his first competition in 1990 and soon began dominating the bodybuilding world, earning his IFBB Pro card as well as countless titles. In fact, Coleman holds the record for the most wins by an IFBB professional – a staggering 26, including eight coveted Mr. Olympia titles."

Perhaps it’s that German bodybuilding blood, but James began lifting at 18 and immediately started to impress everyone. James hasn’t had as many impressive finishes as some of the big bodybuilders – though he’s competed in the Mr. Olympia seven times, his best finish is fourth place. However, he’s consistently maintained his physique over the years, proving that you don’t always need titles to keep up your motivation."

The then 140 pound German-born Ruhl started lifting at nineteen, and after five years, finally competed in his first competition – over 100 pounds heavier, at 243 pounds. He won the heavyweight and overall title at his first competition, the Bachgau Cup, and began a long career of bodybuilding. He soon received his pro card, continued packing on additional muscle mass, and simply grew and grew his amazing physique."

The Austrian-born bodybuilder set records in the fitness world, becoming the youngest person to win the Mr. Universe title when he was 20. He racked up countless titles over the years, including four more Mr. Universe titles and seven coveted Mr. Olympia titles. After an illustrious career in bodybuilding, Schwarzenegger (who had become a U.S. citizen after emigrating to the U.S. in 1968) started conquering another industry – Hollwood. He had roles in several movies, including Hercules, Stay Hungry (for which he won a Golden Globe), and Conan the Barbarian. The film that absolutely made his career, however, was Terminator.

He started training at 16 and entered (and won!) his first competition at 18. He own the Mr. Universe title in 1993, and made the move to the U.S. in 1996 – just like Arnold! In addition to competing, Schlierkamp has done some acting, modeling, and frequently works with companies as a consultant in product development."

As a result, he won over the bodybuilding world winning two Mr. Olympias even after a devastating knee injury, in which he dislocated his knee during the 1977 World’s Strongest Man while carrying a refrigerator on his back.

As such, anyone who has a name that is synonymous with bodybuilding deserves to crack the top 10 of this list. If there is one person that gym-goers would choose to look like, it would be Frank Zane. At only 190 pounds, he was as aesthetically pleasing to the eye as you can get and didn’t look like a grotesque bulky bodybuilder that much of the sport has reckoned with in today’s times due to heavy drugs and a reliance on mass to win bodybuilding titles.Frank Zane had such an incredible physique that he even beat Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1968 IFBB Mr. Universe at a deficit of some 60 pounds. Zane concentrated on stellar lines and attention to detail to beat jaw-dropping mass and was one of the few to ever pull it off. He garnered three straight Olympia titles by out-conditioning the competition and changed the bodybuilding sport forever, being able to win at only 185 pounds with 18″ arms but an unprecedented 29″ waist. If there was ever a guy who had a V-Taper, it was Frank Zane."

He had groundbreaking muscularity and stellar shape. Yet, the 8X Mr. Olympia does not receive nearly the amount of recognition he should and that is certainly disappointing. Tipping the scales at 250 pounds, Haney was bigger than all of his competitors, yet walked on stage with an 8-pack and razor sharp cuts every time. Haney has transformed the sport of bodybuilding forever by dominating the field with mass. Many have tried and ultimately failed to match what Haney has accomplished in terms of matching his size and vascularity.

It is mind boggling to think he didn’t win one Mr. Olympia title with a body like that. His vision to win audiences over with artistic display and proportion has been lost to the “mass” appeal despite his numerous top 5 place finishes in the Olympias. Shawn Ray had a career that ranks among the most impressive in bodybuilding’s history. However, he just was not able to place the Sandow on his mantle. He was packed with a ton of muscle mass, enough to rival any competitor, but moved audiences with his symmetry. He was a rare breed in bodybuilding, and one that is even more scarce now."

He won the Arnold Classic a record four times and was once described by Arnold Schwarzenegger as one of the greatest bodybuilders he had ever seen.

For example: for 10 minutes of swimming you burn 60 calories with the breast stroke, 80 calories with the backstroke, 100 calories with freestyle, and an impressive 150 with the butterfly stroke.

As a double bonus, gardening is a great way to strengthen and tone your major muscle groups, like your abs, back and glutes.Instead of getting on your hands and knees to pull weeds, do it from a standing position.As you bend down from the waist, legs slightly bent, engage your abs. Rise back up slowly, abs still engaged, your hands at your sides. Bring your arms up over your head, exhale all the way and contract your abs ten times in quick succession. Dump your weeds in the wheelbarrow and go back for more.You can also do squats as you weed. With your feet shoulder-width apart, lower yourself into a squat, keeping your core engaged. Pull the weeds and slowly move back into a standing position, and repeat.Paying attention to the muscles you’re working as you putter in the garden can help you figure out ways to engage those muscles more effectively.For example, if you’re watering, hold the nozzle in one hand and part of the hose in the other and perform oblique twists, or do arm and leg extensions when you’re on your hands and knees mulching, planting or thinning."

Again, do this move for as long as you can, and start the hoop right back up if you lose momentum.Finally, stand with your feet together and extend one arm straight out in front of you.

Proper technique is extremely important when you’re running up and down stairs in order to protect your knees and joints from pain and injury. Push off from your toes rather than your heels, and keep your movements controlled to avoid falling. Pump your arms to help propel you and maintain good balance. Because climbing stairs is such an intense activity, you may find it difficult to do it for a full half hour. Using the interval training technique on stairs can make this workout easier on your lungs and body, increase your fat burn and maximize your workout, especially if you’re new to running stairs. Start with a five-minute walk to warm up. Run up the stairs as fast as you safely can, skipping every other step. Once you’re at the top, head back down, hitting each step and keeping your knees high as you descend. Do this for one minute, and then walk up and down the stairs for two minutes.Repeat seven times, and end with another five-minute walk to cool down and stretch your aching muscles."

And did we mention that you’ll burn 297 calories for every half hour you spend on your bike? That means that if your commute is a half hour, you’ll burn almost 600 calories a day just getting to and from your job. Try to devise a route that doesn’t require a lot of stopping. Bike trails, residential streets and bike lanes are ideal for both safety and continuity. Riding on a congested city street can be harrowing, and stopping for traffic lights can lower your momentum and reduce your calorie burn.Equip your bike with a basket or find a comfortable backpack in which to haul your stuff to and from work. Wear breathable fabrics for your ride, and leave plenty of time to cool off and change your clothes in the bathroom before you head into your office.Safety is paramount when you’re riding your bike in town. Always, always wear a helmet. Even a small spill on your bike can result in a traumatic head injury. Obey the traffic laws as though you are driving a car, and remain aware of your surroundings."

Water is your most important friend as far as losing weight and keeping it off. It acts as an appetite suppressant by keeping your stomach full and also helps your body to metabolize and break down stored fat by helping the kidney’s flush out waste. Make sure you drink iced water though (at least 2 litres a day) and not room temperature water. Your body will burn between 60 and 100 calories alone just heating up the water to body temperature. And very often hunger pangs are actually thirst pangs so drinking lots of water will also help to stop overeating. In addition, adding a slice of lemon will not only make the water taste good, you also get the added benefit of the lemon cleansing and detoxing your liver (see #11 home remedy for weight loss), which helps to speed up the fat burning process even more."

This type of calcium is difficult for the body to digest and processed dairy foods will actually have the opposite effect and make you put on weight, not lose it."

Black pepper contains a compound called piperine, which helps reduce fat levels in the blood. Black pepper also enhances the effectiveness of the lemon juice as well. Simply mix the juice of half a fresh lemon in a glass of filtered water. Add a few sprinkles of black pepper (4-6 turns of your pepper grinder) into the mix and drink 3 times daily."

It also gives a potent energy boost (which is great for exercising) and increases mental alertness significantly. Of all the natural “performance enhancers” out there, ginseng is by far the best. You can buy Korean red ginseng (the best form) from most health food suppliers or online. Just be aware that when it comes to purchasing ginseng, the cheaper brands aren’t always the best (many use cheap, low quality ginseng). If you’re interested, this is the highest quality ginseng supplement we’ve managed to come across so far and works incredibly well."
    
    static let Coconut_oil = "Coconut oil is a nutritional marvel. There’s virtually no health problem this amazing food can’t help with – and weight loss is certainly one of them! In studies, coconut oil has been shown to significantly boost metabolism and reduce appetite and food cravings. The MCT’s (medium chain triglycerides) in coconut oil also help the body burn calories by using up fat for energy. Of course, we now know that cutting good fats out of the diet will actually make you gain weight rather than lose it, so you must still receive a daily supply of healthy fats if you want to lose weight. And coconut oil, along with evening primrose oil, are two of the best sources."
    
    static let Iodine = "You may have already read that a poor functioning thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) is one of the main causes of weight gain and one of the main causes not being able to lose weight. This is 100% correct. When you have an underactive thyroid, your metabolism slows dramatically. This is the reason why you still gain weight even if you don’t eat much. A low thyroid also causes severe fatigue and low energy levels. Of course, this makes it virtually impossible to exercise for weight loss and so a vicious cycle develops. You have a slow (probably non-existent) metabolism as well as no energy for exercising so the weight just continues to pile on. Thankfully though, this is relatively easy to fix. By taking in enough liquid iodine and/or kelp, you can easily stimulate and boost your thyroid gland so it begins working correctly and at peak condition once again. When this happens, you’ll literally start to see the fat on your body melt away before your eyes!"
    
    static let Quality_protein_Intake = "Protein helps to convert loose fat into muscle, which is vital for weight loss and toning. Protein is also a great weight control aid as it not only satisfies the palette, it helps keep you fuller for longer. In addition, protein helps stop unwanted insulin and blood sugar level spikes in the body which occur when you consume certain carbohydrates (some carbs can in fact raise your insulin levels quite dramatically and cause sugar cravings and energy loss). So it’s always a good idea to eat some quality protein with a carbohydrate meal. Good protein choices include: Chicken and turkey (without skin and not fried), lean red meat (grilled not fried), lamb, pork, prawns, scallops, fish, eggs, low fat cottage cheese, haloumi, natural yogurt, nuts, seeds, and whey."

Only ever eat natural carbs “from the earth” though, not anything that’s been refined or processed. Best sources include low glycemic (low insulin and blood sugar releasing) fruits such as strawberries, apricots, oranges, nectarines, pears and watermelon, and vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage, asparagus, celery and lettuce. Only eat a small amount of whole grains and beans (kidney beans, etc) too. And remember once again, not too many carbs! "
    
    static let Avoid_Sugar = "Sugar really is enemy number one for weight loss. If you consume high sugary foods and drinks you haven’t got a hope in hell of losing weight. Sugar spikes your body’s insulin and blood sugar levels like nothing else, and once this occurs the energy (calories) from the foods you eat then gets deposited into your fat cells. In addition to this, processed sugars contain lots of empty calories, which also get stored as body fat. And worst of all, refined sugars don’t fill you up as easily as natural foods and they’re also highly addictive so you naturally eat more!Of all the sugars, refined and processed sugars are definitely the worst. So all processed foods must be cut from your diet completely if you want to lose weight. Natural sugars (from fruits and vegetables) are certainly okay, however, we do recommend you stay with the low sugar varieties mentioned above to avoid any unnecessary insulin and blood sugar spikes."
    
    static let Honey_and_cinnamon = "Yes honey contains sugar (natural sugar), but it also helps promote fat metabolism and fat burning. Cinnamon regulates blood sugar levels and insulin levels and stops you from overeating (and is especially good for overweight people who are also diabetics). Used together, these two foods are a powerful weight loss combo. Simply mix 1 teaspoon of organic Ceylon cinnamon powder in a cup of boiled water. Leave to steep for 15-20 minutes then add 1 teaspoon of local or Manuka honey (do not use processed honey). Drink this concoction twice daily on an empty stomach."

It’s a lot easier for your body to digest and burn up small meals than big meals, and the added bonus is you never feel hungry. Just be sure to reduce your portion sizes and only eat until you feel slightly full but satisfied. Don’t eat until you feel as bloated as a pregnant goldfish! And never skip meals either. Your body will go into starvation mode straight away and start storing all of the calories you eat from that point on (not a good thing). This is the theory and basis behind the hugely successful book “French Women Don’t get Fat”."
    
    static let Never_leave_house_hungry = "This is one of the biggest blunders of all people trying to lose weight. When you shop on an empty stomach those treats all look irresistible, but when you shop on a full stomach the cravings simply aren’t there as much. In addition to this, do not buy any foods that you know you may struggle with as far as cravings go. If you struggle with chips, for instance, don’t have packets sitting in the pantry. Every time you go to the pantry you’re going to see them and that’s not going to help your cause at all. And don’t use excuses such as “they’re for the kids” or “they were on special” or whatever. Just don’t have them in the house - period! You can’t eat what ain’t there!"

Continue this treatment regularly for at least three to four months.Research shows that curry leaves contain mahanimbine, an alkaloid that has anti-obesity and lipid-lowering effects. Thus, it helps lower body weight and reduces total cholesterol and triglyceride levels."
    
    static let Rose_petal_Water = "The benefits of rose petal water are backed more by anecdotal evidence than anything, but that’s no reason to shrug off this mild yet refreshing drink. Rose petals act as a very gentle diuretic. Diuretics encourage your kidneys to put more sodium (salt) into your urine. This excess salt in turn draws water from your blood, decreasing the amount of water in your circulatory system. This is not “permanent” weight loss-just water weight-but the action encourages you to drink more and keep your system flushed clean and hydrated. Staying hydrated, believe it or not, can be hugely beneficial to losing weight."
    
    static let Chewing_gum = "Sugar free Chewing gum is a great way to trick your brain (and your stomach) into thinking it’s getting more than it is. The flavor of the gum reduces appetite and curbs the urge to snack on something unhealthy, and also stimulates the flow of saliva, whose enzymes help break down starches and fats."

Everything has to be working harmoniously for things to be balanced and correct-like your weight. Studies have shown that even just a little bit of sleep deprivation over the short time frame of 4 nights results in increased insulin resistance, and essentially ages the metabolism 10-20 years in that time frame. The fat cells sensitivity to insulin dropped by 30% to levels usually seen in people who were obese or diabetic. By getting the right amount of sleep, you’re doing more than just resting your body-you’re ensuring that all systems are go, and that you have the best chance possible to succeed at losing weight."
    
    static let Black_pepper_lemon = "This spicy little concoction contains black pepper and lemon juice to create a drink that can help you keep ahead on your weight loss battle. Black pepper contains a naturally occurring chemical compound called piperine, which is responsible for giving it its pungent flavor. Several new studies have shown that piperine can interfere with the genes that control the generation of fat cells, as well as reducing fat levels in the blood stream and enhancing the absorption of nutrients from our foods. Lemon juice can help aid in digestion and give your G.I. track a helping hand when it comes to breaking down foods."
    
    static let Apple_Snacks = "An apple a day keeps the weight at bay! While not overflowing with nutrients like other fruits or vegetables, apples still have a number of benefits that can contribute to weight loss. First, they are packed with fiber, which helps curb appetite, so eat one when you feel the urge to snack on some less-desirable foods. Second, they can help regulate blood sugar levels, and therefore help regulate your appetite and energy levels. Third, the pectin in apples can lower cholesterol, and serve as another way to help regulate blood sugar, by slowing the absorption of carbohydrates. Finally, apples are a naturally low-sodium food, which can help prevent excess water retention and water weight."
